,,1199,"38 Male, 6 foot, 232lbs, White, Happened 11 hours ago in my bathroom, Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, No medication

At 8 pm last night, my wife and I had food poisoning that caused us to throw up. Was hickory farms sausage and cheese.

That said, her vomit looked normal. Mine on the other hand was bloody. The vomiting for me happened at around 2 AM thereafter. Only vomited once too. The rest of my bathroom visits were just diarrhea, which looked normal.

That said, should I be worried if this just happened once? Can I assume it’s just from the food poisoning?

Let me know your thoughts.

Thank you!

,,1200,"I (34F) started developing health anxiety this past summer. I came down with digestive issues. I shouldn't have done it, but I Googled and came across pancreatic cancer. Then, I went on the subreddit and saw posts by plenty of people in their 30s with this cancer. From then on, it was all I could think about. When I failed to get my symptoms (nausea, belching, burning stomach, acid in throat, lack of appetite) under control with OTC medication, I went to the ER. I was dropping weight, and I was 100% certain it was pancreatic. 

They took me seriously and did a CT with contrast, an abdominal X-ray, and tons of blood work. All came back clear, and then they scheduled me for an endoscopy which showed mild, chronic gastritis (inactive), and I started Omeprazole as well as Zoloft. Things were looking up for a bit as symptoms improved. 


However, now after a stomach virus, my symptoms have come back, and I'm once again in the pancreatic cancer spiral. I'm convinced the CT scan missed the cancer or the radiologist just read it wrong because I'm young. I can't stop thinking about it, reading about it, etc. 

I KNOW I'm being illogical. I KNOW I should bring this up to my GP. However, I'm scared if I do, I'll be labeled as a hypochondriac and from then on any health concern I have won't be taken seriously. 


What should I do??",,

I have no allergies besides penicillin that I know of. I have a strange occurrence happening every once in a while. Starting about a year and a half ago, my left eye would feel numb/cold in one spot (almost like someone was blowing into it) along with a line of my left lip directly below the eye but not on my cheek. This happened just a few times the first year. After the 3rd time, I went back and noted the time it happened, what I was doing, and what I had eaten. There were no correlations. This August until now, it has happened monthly and lately sometimes happens weekly. The tingling/coldness/numbness occasionally starts out on one side and moves to the other side. It’s almost always in my eye and just a small part of my lip. No one can see or feel anything different in my face when it’s happening and I can move all parts of my face. (I had our school RN check me out once when it happened at work.) I finally went to the doctor and he ran tests to see if I was vitamin deficient because he couldn’t think of anything else. Tests came back normal. He said he wasn’t worried but I could do a brain scan if it kept happening. Since my appointment it happens weekly or every other week but doesn’t last long. Any ideas of what could be happening??",,

Occasional smoker although haven't smoked in months

I have been dealing with mild cold and cough that seems to reoccur a few times a year. However in the last 2 months my cough has been persistent and has not really gone away. It is usually accompanied by runny nose, sinus and low grade fever. I have been coughing since the start of the nov. I have wheezing as well. My doc suggested its COPD and caused by pollution, we do live in a highly polluted city. I did react well to allergy medication, wheezing went away but the cough returned. The dry cough turned to wheezing again along with cold. 

I did a complete blood test and a chest xray. Blood test shows high level of IgE serum shows high as in the bio ref is 0-100.0 and mine shows 210.3 
Rest is pretty ok, my WBC count is slightly higher. 

But the XRay report says ""Soft Tissue opacity is seen widening the right paratracheal strip- could be enlarged lymphnodes'. I have been told to go for CET scan. 

What could this possibly be?",,
,,1203,"So basically I boxed my friend while drunk last night and took some pretty bad blows to the back of the head. My friend has no experience in boxing but weights a good 30 pounds more than me. The fight lasted like one minute so it wasn’t like I got pounded for an extended period of time.

I did get punched a couple times in the back of the head and the next morning it hurts when I shake my head. No nausea, sensitivity to bright light, or other concussion symptoms (I think).

I think I’m fine but I am pretty anxious about brain damage or some kind of brain bleed. I don’t plan on taking anymore blows to the head. 

Should I see a doctor or am I alright?",,

IMPRESSION: T2 hyperintense linear polypoid structures noted beginning at the caudal one third of the anal canal near the 7 o'clock position. This extends inferiorly to the anal verge and measures 2.0 cm in extent. This may be confined to the submucosal space and does not clearly extend through the internal anal sphincter to the intersphincteric fat. This is a good correlate for the reported hypertrophied anal papilla seen at anoscopy. However, a sinus tract or fistula confined to the submucosal space is not excluded.

Does anyone have any recommendations or took any medications for swelling after a fracture? My father is 70 years old (male and has high blood pressure) and has a Weber B fracture to the fibula (happened approximately 8 weeks ago) and still has a lot of swelling, especially when he puts his foot down. He is having trouble walking because of the swelling, is there anything he could take? His fracture is still healing so we don’t want to take any medication that can slow or stop the healing.

On Nuvaring 15 years and honestly not as consistent as i should be with removing for periods. I removed it last night and had light spotting almost immediately (usually takes 2-3 days for period to start after removal). No cramps, no pain, woke up a bit heavier flow than normal but not enough to use a pad/tampon. 

Headed out for a run and 3 miles in, I felt THAT feeling. I still had 3 miles left and thought I was going to be bleeding through my shorts with how much blood it felt like had come out. Got home and went to shower expecting a bloodbath. Looked down and did a double take thinking my vagina had fallen out of me - the sex education system seems to have completely failed me. Removed ""the glob"" and mushed it around some trying to figure out what the he*l it was. 

Internet seems to say Decidual Cast but we all know Reddit has the actual answers - can someone help me ID this? Also, everyone seems to agree I should have been having some insane cramping along the way but I feel completely fine. Not a single cramp, no back pain, no nausea - I really don't know what to think. 

I'll take any information and tips you have friends 🧡",,

Started 2 weeks back and it’s a severe throbbing headache that happens only when I workout. My entire head hurts not just a part of it. No nausea or dizziness or vomiting. Never had this before but it happens only when i do strenuous physical activity like working out. I take creatine, whey protein and preworkout everyday alongside multivitamins, omega-3 and biotin supplements. My hydration is also good and I sleep for minimum 8-9 hours a day. I also took a break from gym for 3-4 days and when I went back I still had the headache. I thought it was due to the weight being too much for me but I noticed it happens even when I do body weight exercises like pushups and pull-ups and still happens even if i decrease the weight by a lot. however, it doesn’t happen when I do boxing.

Good evening users, I don't know if I will find any kind of answer here but it is worth trying having faith in the power of the internet. I'm 24 years old and my brother is exhausted just like us. My family has literally been plagued by an illness for a year and we can't get over it. It all started in January last year, when I had violent gastroenteritis (jet vomiting) for two days. Everything seemed normal, a banal gastroenteritis or intoxication (as fate would have it, a Japanese restaurant served me raw chicken a few days before and I realized it too late). After 5 days the nausea and intestinal pain do not go away, and my brother shows the same symptoms. To make a long story short, a year later we are constantly suffering from nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, hyperacidity and cramps. I can tolerate the pain and nausea and am able to lead an almost normal life. No, my brother is 28 years old and can't get out of bed. He is weak and no longer eats, he has lost weight and has lost muscle mass. Every now and then he has a good week in which he manages to eat enough to not suffer from pathological anorexia, but he is still underweight. We spoke to immunologists, gastroenterologists and psychologists, IT'S NOT PSYCHOSOMATIC! We have done all kinds of tests (unfortunately ruining ourselves financially) and we highlight dysbiosis and positivity to Cytomegalovirus. In the hospital they can only give him a few infusions but they don't admit him until his life is in danger. A few years ago my brother suffered from a serious evolution of mononucleosis which took him to hospital where he was severely immunosuppressed and where he was also wrongly diagnosed with HIV while awaiting tests. We are desperate, we don't know what to do, I can live with this disease, my brother can't.",,

Does this ultrasound indicate early pregnancy at all? I also tested positive on an at home pregnancy test and had a transvaginal/abdominal ultrasound done (not related to the pregnancy test). 

My doctor is out so he hasn’t responded with the results and I’m being impatient. I know the doctor will be able to give me an answer after reviewing, but if anyone has any insight while I’m waiting for his response, I would appreciate the feedback! 

These are just 2 photos of the ultrasound, a lot more were taken but I’m wondering if there may be a sac on these? Also, my endometrial stripe was really thick. I’m not sure what that indicates.

About 2-3 weeks ago I ate a heavy meal with chocolate and a cheeseburger (been fixing up a house so plz don’t judge me for that.) everything seemed fine and waited my time limit before sleeping. Woke up about 5 hours later to extreme bloating feeling and pain on the upper right side of my stomach. I paced around for 3 hours in this pain debating on going to the doctors. I took tums, omeprazole (40 mg) and Gaviscon. After 3 hours it subsided and I never went in. Over the next few weeks I could still feel the pain in my upper right side of the stomach but it was lessened and felt like it was on the mend. A few days ago the heartburn started getting worse despite eating light, eating heartburn friendly foods and taking 40-80 mg of omeprazole, 4-5 ultra strength tums and a sip of Gaviscon. My chest down my spine hurts the worst but my whole chest feels like acid is splashing around the entire chest cavity. Been having off and on diarrhea.

,,1212,"Female, late 30s, no relevant medical history apart from that I don't remember ever having swollen tonsils before. 

Around 12-18 months ago I noticed a little pink nubbin by my tonsil. Showed the dentist, declined a referral to ent because I'm petty and they disappointed me a few times already. I saw maxfax who said they don't do tonsils but it looked ok. I mostly ignored it and the dentist had a quick look to check it hadn't grown on checkups. Had a bad cough around November and I looked because my throat was sore and the nubbin was purple. A few days later it was yellow and then it disappeared, likely just swallowed it in my sleep. While it was there I would squeeze tonsil stones from behind it every so often. So I started again about a month ago, and this week I noticed the hole there. Not sure whether to just stop messing and wait till I see the dentist in Jan/Feb. But will it get disgusting if it's not cleaned out?

I used to drink a lot of regular coffee but after this infection even a little bit of regular would cause me diarrhea, so I switched to decaf. I still have instant diarrhea if I drink any regular coffee. I used to never have any trace of loose stool ever, very much the opposite.

I've been sick with some mystery illness for three weeks & the biggest symptom I've been dealing with is a very, very sore throat. It's like right in each of my tonsils & I can feel it so bad when I swallow or eat so I'm not eating. It's the worst sore throat I've had to date. I also have a lingering semi. productive cough that was very productive prior to one round of doxycycline. I finished a 7 day course of the doxycycline & was feeling better mostly minus a very dull pain still in my throat & a normal cough. & To note, I've been swabbed for flu, covid, strep, & RSV. All negative. 

Fast forward to a week later. Excruciating sore throat is back, cough is there but is only really bad at night where I cough so much I nearly throw up all night. 

My primary care Dr gave me a steroid shot today & prescribed me levofloxacin. Since I'm coming back negative for literally everything & he said the doxycycline didn't seem to do the job fully, he said he was putting me on a strong antibiotic & if I got a side effect like leg aches not to worry, to just finish my course because it's common. 

So naturally, I went to Dr Google & freaked myself WAY out over the chance of becoming what they refer to as ""floxed.""

How common is this? Any knowledge of this particular antibiotic? I saw someone even say it has a black box warning that it could cause nerve issues which I already deal with. I'm very hesitant to take this, but I'm not getting better & I can't handle the pain of the sore throat anymore.

I sometimes have chest pressure after eating, but I usually chalk this up to indigestion. However, yesterday after having a big meal a few hours prior, I was lying in bed I started feeling some flutters in my chest. This caused me to cough, but I wasn't sure if it was from my lungs or heart palpitations. Then, my heart started beating rapidly. I looked at my watch and it was 125, up from 60-70 resting. I was instantly panicked and got up and walked around, preparing to potentially call 911. I got a drink of water and noticed I was very thirsty. After drinking 3 cups of water, my heart rate gradually went down over a minute or so. I searched online and saw that being dehydrated along with eating a lot can raise heart rate, but I don't know why this happened so suddenly, and it has never happened before. It's been fine today, but does this warrant a doctor's visit? Thanks

How does this affect his life span? Does it really take a huge toll?

,,1234,"Hi, I've (F21) been struggling with UTI for the past 2 weeks. I went to doctor, because furazidinum didn't work, got antibiotics for it and it looks like they didn't work either (Ciprofloxacin) - I was taking them for 6 days and I haven't seen any difference and I was supposed to take them for 7 days. Today I went to do a test (urine culture examination) but the doctor said it might not be correct because I've been taking those antibiotics. I decided to do it anyways because Im really worried infection will spread to kidneys before ill be able to do the test and get a result and Ill end up in hospital which is not ideal for me (I would have to take a break from uni....). So my question is - is there a chance test will work since antibiotics didnt work anyways? Also, should I continue to take the antibiotics that looks like they didn't work? I'm really stressed about that infection spreading to kidneys (is it reasonable for now?). I drink a lot of herbal tea and water in general (the more I drink the less it hurts while peeing). I also take vitamin C with cranberry extract. 

About if I'm sure its UTI - I'm 99% sure it is because furazidinum seemed to work at first but I did a very bad thing which was stopping in taking it because in the beginning of all this I had wisdom tooth removal and had a problem with swallowing anything other than liquid. When I came back to it It didn't make a difference because it probably developed a resistance... Also antibiotics (Amoxicillin, clavulanic acid) that I got after wisdom tooth removal are apparently also used in UTIs but it looks like they didn't work for that either...Which makes me even more worried :(

,,1236,"I am 23F with beta thalassemia. My family has a history of Lupis which my doctors have previously tried to send me to a rheumatologist for but I encountered difficulty making an appointment. I am going to see one eventually but I’m sure it will be many months before I can get to that point in the process. 

I’m encountering a lot of difficulties with having poor circulation right now. These symptoms have always occurred but seems to be increasing in frequency and intensity with age.

The two most bothersome are head rushes and raynaud’s in my fingers and toes. My head rushes are leaving me extremely dizzy, sometimes to the point where I fall and it is taking much longer for my vision and hearing to return, and that static fuzzy feeling I get is lasting much longer as well. My hands (especially one of my pinkies) get white and numb quickly and my toes sometimes blister even when the cold is mild. 

I read that you can use compression socks to help with some of these symptoms, but in the past they’ve made my symptoms much worse. Sometimes if i sleep in socks (any socks not even just compression) my feet will blister and my sleep is disrupted as it’s numb and painful. 

Of course, I need to see a rheumatologist but Id prefer to have some help while I do all of the preliminary testing for a doctor to consider seeing me. Can I use compression wraps? I think adjusting the intensity could help me in a way i can’t have with socks. Could I wrap my arms/hands/wrists to help? or will this make things worse?",,

I had birth 1.5 months ago, c-section. All went well, until I rushed to the emergency (3 weeks after birth) for having sharp and unbearable stomach pain. It turned out I had gallbladder stones and the doctors decided to operate. They performed a cholecystectomy and the next day they did an endoscope telling me that some parts of the stone got stuck and they will basically clean up the remains. I was under anesthesia during both of the procedures. But after the second procedure, immediately I started having a sharp burning pain my eyes and throat. My face was swollen up and I couldn't open my eyes at all. I had difficulty breathing. I went on a couple hours feeling this way and the doctor didn't give me any reason or diagnosis for this. Just telling me it will go, it's normal.

My sister just asked them if it was a **postoperative non allergic angioedema** (after googling and trying to help me) and the doctor in that moment was surprised that we asked that and just said it might be. That's it.

I went through 3 awful days at the hospital with no clear explanation of the procedures.

Then, 10 days ago, I started to have this rash around the wounds, it started to get worse and worse day by day with extreme itchiness.

Now, my doctor was supposed to meet me for a follow up but no one answers the phone. I contacted my family doctor which just told me to go to urgent care or a walk in clinic because she cannot find any other solution for me.

I am in so much pain and discomfort because of the rash. I got these medications 3 days ago from urgent care:

\- benadryl

\- cerave anti-itch

\- dicloxacillin 500 mg capsules

\- Triamcinolone Acetonite Ointment

&#x200B;

It trully seems like nothing seems to work. I just left another walk in clinic now and the doctors just told me we don't know what you have. Meanwhile I cannot reach my doctor for the follow up. Everything seems impossible due to holidays. I don't know what else to do.

Hello so I've had brown spots in my legs for years with no other symptoms.

I recently switched to a new doctor and they recommended to get an ultra sound in case it's DVT or something else.

Meanwhile they told me to sleep with my legs raised and wear compression stocking so I did. 

It's been a few a days of me doing this and recently I've had sharp pain in my inner thighs. Both of them(both legs have spots).

I'm currently freaking the fuck out since apparently you can die in your sleep? Should I be concerned?

When touching the spots there's a sharp pain",,
,,1239,"(31F, 163 cm, 63kg) I’ve been drinking excessively for the last year. It’s a horrible coping mechanism for what my life has become but today I vow to quit. I drink about 5-6 white claws, 3 times a week. I’m so ashamed. On Christmas Eve, I drank 4 white claws on an empty stomach. Then I ate some questionable lasagna. The next day I woke up , extremely nauseous, tons of heart burn. I attributed it to the lasagna. The day before I ate McDonald’s for lunch and dinner (gross). I got worse through the day and threw up twice. No diarrhea. No gas. I assumed I had food poisoning from either McDonald’s or lasagna. I’ve been having “cramps” that come and go right around my belly button. They feel like the beginning of labor contractions. After doing some “googling” I came upon pancreatitis. I’m freaking out. I haven’t thrown up today and the pain is about a 3 on a 0-10 scale. Should I go to the hospital? Thinking back could the combination of the McDonald’s and drinking cause this pain? I have no fever either

ETA: before this year I never drank other than the occasional glass of wine twice a year

Patient has had recurrent UTIs. At least that is what the doctor called it. She had a terrible UTI in December of 2021 that was resistant to multiple antibiotics. This resolved once treated with the appropriate ABX. She was treated about 3-4 weeks ago for another UTI. This was her only UTI other than the one she had in 12/2021. The most recent culture (12/3) came back positive for e-coli and the lab had recommended an ID consult which myself and pediatrician thought was a little weird given e-coli is pretty typical for a UTI. We elected to hold off on ID consult given her TERRIBLE anxiety when going to doctors (thanks to the rocephin shots for a prior ear infection). I will post the 12/2021 culture beow. Obviously this sub will not let me include attachments. 

She saw her PCP one week after she finished her antibiotic (amox if I remember correctly) and we were told that her UTI resolved, but they wanted to send her for an ultrasound to check her kidneys. My husband took her to the doctor that time, so I really don’t have a lot of info. Her urinalysis never posted to her my chart from that visit. Her pediatrician didn’t really document in the note as to WHY the ultrasound was being requested. 

Anyway, she had her US done this morning which came back abnormal. Historically, her pediatrician is extremely difficult to get a hold of and I really just want some answers. I’m more concerned about the size of her kidneys and what this actually indicates? How concerning is this and will we likely be referred to endocrinology? 
I was suspicious that she may have another UTI given the smell of her urine. She has ZERO other symptoms and has no complaints of pain or burning with urination.

Anyway, I was sitting on the floor while working on my pc with my legs crossed and i bent my back forward to try to get a cord into a tight spot, then my foot cramped. usually when this happens I try to stand on the affected foot before it gets too bad. So I did this maneuver that involved me balancing my hands behind me to jump my legs out under me so I could get up as quick as possible. However, when I got up, my body started to like... tense up. like, my body starts to forcefully move on its own in a way I can't control. the muscles in my body tighten up and I have to work against it to maintain composure. This isn't the first time I've experienced this, so while it was happening I started to vocalize my frustration about it to myself, only to realize that my tongue was also being affected by it while it was happening. the event didn't last long, only a few seconds (they always do). now, the thing that made me think that perhaps it was a mini-stroke was this tight sensation with the slightest suggestion of pain localized in a spot on the right side of my head that stayed there for some time after (like maybe an hour or two?). I'm not even sure that's a symptom of a stroke but I'm honestly at a loss for what it could be at this point. a tumor maybe? I have no idea. would appreciate some kind of response.",,

I noticed these red marks on the underside of my left breast a few days ago and they haven’t gone away. I’m really worried that the redness could be a sign of IBC. My maternal aunt had breast cancer in her late 40s (caught early, she is cancer-free now after surgery); both she and my mom tested negative for the BRCA gene. 
My PCP did a physical breast exam on me last year after my aunt was diagnosed and said everything felt normal, but she did say that my breasts were dense and to me they always feel pretty lumpy. My PCP also ran a CBC/metabolic panel about a month ago at my yearly physical and said everything looked fine. 
I have one enlarged lymph node on the right side of my neck that has been ultrasounded twice in two years to be safe and has always been assessed as looking normal (no biopsy, though). My PCP said it might be related to dermatitis flare ups that I get on my scalp/back of neck. A dermatologist prescribed fluocinonide to use as needed on the dermatitis. The redness on my breast doesn’t feel rough like that. 
Does this look like potential breast cancer? I don’t know if I should try the fluocinonide or another cream on it first to see if it goes away, or if I should try to see a doctor ASAP.

Hey all! I’m hoping I can find an alternative medication to ask my doctor about. 

25F, non smoker, no current medications (except for the Levothyroxine), 4 mos postpartum. 

I have hypothyroidism that was diagnosed in 2020. After months of taking my levithyroxine as instructed by my doctor and the pharmacist I found out that the reason I felt so sick all the time is due to consuming calcium within 4 hours of taking the medication. 

It is extremely unrealistic for me to eliminate calcium from my diet, and trying to manage when to take my medication within the proper timeframe after consuming dairy has proven extremely difficult for me.

I am recovering from a nasty sinus/throat infection I caught over a week ago. It started with a sore throat, and then two days later the pain briefly transferred to my right ear. It was very painful for around two hours, so I went to the GP (by which point the pain had already subsided).He said my ear canal did not look like I had an infection, but the earlier (albeit very brief) pain suggests maybe I did, but that is barely relevant. 

Next day, all the pain in my ear was gone, but it felt very full and blocked, meaning my (mild) pre-existing tinnitus was much more noticeable in quiet places. My hearing in that ear was also significantly impaired. This has remained the case for the last week. The sore throat took a long time to clear, along with intermittent nasal congestion and coughing, but has finally done so, meaning all I am now left with is this unpleasent sensation of fluid in the ear. Although my hearing in that ear has improved a little, it is still definitely containing at least some fluid. Is this something that will go away gradually on its own or should I do something? There is no pain so it's definitely not infected.",,

,,1255,"Hello! 16F who has been searching for an answer to my ear issues for a long time. No physical medical conditions, I take 5mg lexapro daily. English is not my first language, apologies for any misunderstandings.

My hearing problems started about three years ago, maybe even more. My little brother was quite loud and would almost always scream in my ear. I’m not sure if his screaming is linked to this, but around that time I started noticing my left ear being weird.

My left ear starts making static noises when I experience loud sounds that come from all around me. One of the most prominent examples comes from choir. I sing in choir and vocal ensemble, so I am constantly surrounded by loud sound. Whenever these sounds happen (when the choir starts singing), my left ear starts making static noises that drown out the choir, and even myself. My friends have noticed that I speak rather loudly, and find it difficult to identify sound dynamics in casual conversation (sometimes I speak too loud in a setting, even though I think I am whispering).

Another notable factor is that I have the ability to make my ears rumble. I have noticed that over time, the ability to make my left ear rumble is significantly less strong and slower. It just keeps getting worse. I heard something about this being due to having control over the tensor tympani muscle, so I am wondering if perhaps this may have to do something with it.

Finally, when I move my bottom jaw to the right, there is a whooshing sound that is much louder than when I move my jaw to the left. It’s like there is something opening up within the inside of my ear.

I have gone to many, many, MANY pediatricians and ENTs (drove hours to visit doctors to no avail). I did hearing tests, which all came out indicating that I was perfectly fine. But I had told them that doing hearing tests where I am wearing headphones don’t work, because for some reason loud noises do not bother me when they are from headphones, only in an open environment. They still said I was fine, said they would let me know the next steps, and never contacted us back. It’s been a whole year, and I had pretty much given up on it until I found this subreddit.

Have had POTS type symptoms for 2 years since I began to get bilateral sciatica and had an MRI. This came back with central disc protrusion at l4/l5 causing lateral recess stenosis bilaterally with compression of both transiting L5 nerve roots.

Ive thrown a lot of money at finding the cause and have gotten nowhere so far other than low range ferritin. I very possibly have adenomyosis and endometriosis and have also been looking into pelvic congestion syndrome. Ive also heard of May Thurners as a differential diagnosis to these conditions and also in POTS.

I have my 2 year old lumbar MRI. I wondered if someone could take a look at the small videos I made of it to see if it is worth me pursuing a vascular issue like May Thurners where my spine issue is? I inverted the colours of one in the hope its more visble.

My symptoms that bother me the most are fatigue and brain fog and when I stand up it feels like my blood is heavy rushing downwards, almost dragging me down and I go dizzy, general dizziness and pelvic and back pressure and pain.

She woke up with phlegmy voice last tuesday, tested negative for covid consistently (including the final as a molecular with flu A and B tested). Since then her cough has stayed mild except in the evenings it's been more wet. Today (day 6) she had wet cough all day. She has not had any other symptoms the entire time: energy, temperature, nasal, sore throat, chest, or stomach. It has literally just been a phlegmy cough that was resolving before becoming more present today. Her energy has been fine and I noticed if I take her out for exercise where she's upright, her coughing goes way down, so I think part of it is post-nasal drip based on lounging at home.

The other variables are last week had terrible air quality where we live, and also the first really big rainstorm of the season on Monday/Tuesday, including strong sudden downpours which always affect our allergies. Her school spends a lot of time outside too.

She has no prior respiratory issues, allergies, or signs of asthma. She does have a history of heat sensitivity but it has been cool here (SF Bay Area)

,,1265,"Hello, recently I (20M, 5’3” 110lbs, non smoker) have been a little worried. It started a few weeks ago when I ate some spicy food and then had to poop. Everything seemingly passed fine but it still felt like there was poop so I kept trying and then after a while I gave up. Since then, I have been pooping fine but one thing that worries me is a lump about an inch into my rectum that I felt in the shower. It feels like a little fleshy lump coming from the front of the wall which I would assume is making it kind of difficult to poop occasionally. It’s not visible from the outside, but if I feel it with my finger it feels fleshy on the outside but kind of dense. It hasn’t been causing problems so I’ve kind of just been monitoring it and feeling with my finger to see if anything about changes. The weird thing is there is no pain from it, both while pooping or when poking it. Is it just something I never noticed was there or is it new? it hasn’t been causing any pain and generally i’ve been pooping just fine, just a little concerned. Thanks!",,
,,1266,"I am a 39 year old male, 200 lbs, 5'8"", not currently taking any medications, and currently smoke about 1.5 packs of cigarettes a day.

So I have a variety of health issues, both physical and mental. Got tired of chasing the physical and ignoring the mental (even though I believe mental issues are physical at their root) and started seeing a psychiatrist.

After 4 visits, I basically got dumped. No fault to the doctor, she is limited to what help she can provide at that practice (virtual psychiatry).

She listed a laundry list as to why I need to seek neurological help. A schizophrenic mother, 4 moderate to severe head traumas, possible Lyme disease infection from a deer tick, a brown recluse bite (not sure why she listed that one), and a family history of MS and Lou Gehrig’s disease. She recommended I look into getting an MRI, electroencephalogram, and then brain injury rehabilitation.

I've been getting seizure like episodes from smoking as well. I know, I need to quit and have a plan for it.. but I never really pushed the issue with a doctor cause they are only brought on when I experience oxygen deprivation while smoking. Been happening for 3 to 5 years, lost track really, and happens at a frequency of anywhere between once every couple of months to 5 times a day.

But the other night, I got one for the first time not while smoking. I had a coughing fit and I am guessing that that somehow triggered it.

They only last about 5 to 10 seconds. I lose all my senses, can't see or hear anything. Sense of balance goes, and my hands will shake to where I'll likely drop whatever I am holding.

I am looking for a new primary care doctor who I can talk about all these and not feel weird.. and one with a good network so I don't get referred to some place that's over an hour away.

In the meantime, I live right down the road from the local hospital. Can I just go to the hospital to have an MRI and/or EEG done? I'd rather do that since I live so close, it's easier for me as I can't travel far, and don't have to wait for referrals and such.

Should I tell them about the psychiatry stuff or just go in after I have one of those mini seizures? I took the day off Thursday to go in, just wondering what the best route would be to get the things done that I need. Should I just go right to the ER?

Edit: I have decent health insurance, just finding a primary doctor I can talk to is hard. I'd rather show.",,

A Narrative
EXAMINATION: MRI OF THE LEFT SHOULDER

Clinical Information: 26-year-old with left shoulder pain following recent dislocation.

Description:

Technique: Magnetic resonance imaging of the left shoulder was performed without intravenous contrast administration at 3.0 Tesla utilizing multisequence multiplanar technique.

Comparison: Correlation is made with left shoulder radiographs dated December 16, 2023.

Findings:

Rotator cuff: An approximately 40-50% thickness articular surface tear of the posterior supraspinatus tendon medial to the footprint measures up to 0.3 cm in AP dimension (series 4 and 5, image 18 and series 6, image 25). Moderate subscapularis tendinosis is visualized. The infraspinatus and teres minor tendons are intact. No full-thickness rotator cuff tear is present. There is no disproportionate atrophy of the rotator cuff musculature. 

Acromioclavicular joint: The joint is well maintained. No subacromial enthesophyte is seen. There is no os acromiale. The acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are intact and the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular intervals are maintained.

Glenohumeral joint: A circumferential labral tear propagates into the intra-articular biceps tendon. The posterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament is completely torn from its humeral attachment with associated redundant capsular tissue along the posteroinferior glenoid (series 6, image 17 and series 3, image 13). A large joint effusion is present. No focal cartilage defect is seen. There is no glenoid bone loss.

Biceps tendon: The extra-articular long head of biceps tendon is of normal course, caliber, and morphology.

Osseous structures: Bone marrow signal intensity is within normal limits inclusive of traction related cyst formation within the posterior greater tuberosity. No fracture is identified.

Other: Small fluid is visualized within the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa. The deltoid tendons are intact.",,

To preface, I have done my googling but I don’t want to fall into a paranoid rabbit hole. I worked a 9 hour shift today & in the process of it, I was running with a heavy-duty leaf blower (at least 15lbs) and managed to run the blower into an arm rest (I co-manage a movie theatre), ramming into my abdomen/sternum. It was the center of my abdomen and was enough force to knock me back a few feet. 

Immediately afterwards I felt a loooottt of pain, I stepped out for a bit, and I started pouring sweat and feeling nauseous. I was able to recollect and get back in the groove but I definitely did not rest when I needed to. 

I didn’t really have an appetite after work and I feel so sore now. I can feel a burning/aching feeling where I hit it. My back hurts on both lower sides but I did just work an excruciating shift so I’m not entirely sure how to calculate that. I have not thrown up, and I haven’t passed any blood in my stool or urine ~2hrs after my shift. I know those are green flags. My resting heart rate has been 110-120bpm since I’ve been home and laying in bed for about 2 hours now. It never usually lasts this long especially when I’m laying down and have done breathing exercises, which kind of make the pain a teeeeny bit worse. I don’t have any immediate bruising, I can see the literal square of the blower battery right on my sternum. 

I’m at a good 3 on the pain scale with 10 being the best, unsure how I’ll feel tomorrow. Is any of this of concern/anything else I need to look out for? I have a body heat wrap I’m thinking of using to help with the pain and some Tylenol after my shower.

,,1300,"3 weeks ago I had a damn brick thrown at my forehead by a homeless crackhead, I should’ve filed a charge but didn’t bother and never saw him at the same spot again - instant concussion though.

It has been getting better to the point I forgot I even had it, my brain returned back to normal. All was going well until 2 days ago, in the shower I jolted my head against the wall hard as hell because I sneezed and had my eyes closed. I think I was extremely close to the wall because it felt like no regular bump, I full on smashed my forehead into the wall.

Ever since then, I have felt the concussion I thought I was over with get 1000x worse, nothing like I have experienced before.

To list:

My vision is double, never had vision problems before.

My ability to think feels half gone, i can no longer form exact words in my head and just act more on instinct.

There’s constantly a burning, pounding straight line feeling across my forehead

Everything feels brighter, louder, fuzzy, and distorted as if I’m wearing a VR headset.

Once again, its been TWO DAYS since I banged my head and all mentioned above doesn’t seem to be getting better in the slightest.

This is hell, and it shouldn’t be happening to me. It wouldn’t be happening if I went down a different road that day, or if I looked down at my phone while passing that dude. It’s depressing.

But I don’t wanna dread over it happening too much, I want to focus on recovery. And sadly, it feels like there’s not much chance for my brain to recover damage-free. At the very least I think I’ll have a few brain lesions (lowest form of brain damage) based on how I feel and the intense strength of what hit my head both times.

I haven’t gone to the hospital for a scan though, and honestly I don’t want to because if it reveals visible damage and I’ll be like THIS for the rest of my life, I don’t know how I’ll live or if I want to continue.

Just a vent really, but what are your thoughts? Is there hope for me recovering damage-free?",,

I have this issue for some time now (at least since 2019).

So I grabbed my sock at the exact location and pulled it away from my hair - or so I always thought. Not too long ago I started feeling it on my chest (though I have no chest hair) and especially today I felt it under my arm pit.

39 yo f

I have calcifications in one breast that appeared some time between a mammo in jan 21 and oct 23. A stereostatic biopsy was recommended but I absolutely could not go through with the procedure. They needed me to stay more still. I could not possibly be any more still as I was locked into the machine! They refused to continue for fear of getting the wrong spot. If I try again, we will have the same outcome. 

At a bear minimum, I need everyone in the room masked, which no one was. That alone was stressing me to death. Nevermind the excruciating pain and fear of being trapped. Obviously, I'm very concerned and want to know what these calcifications are, but I'd like to get opinions on if this is necessary in my case or just undue trauma for what's likely benign.

I tried getting a teledoc app so someone could look over my films and we could discuss, but I can't even get that much. You have to come in just to chat.

Had my whole household get bronchitis so when I got sick it wasn’t a surprise. DayQuil always helps me but I always take the syrups because I’m not a pill fan. I ran out of syrup after the first day so I used the DayQuil pills for the next two days. 1st day on the pill- I took 2pills, 2x. Two in the morning and the other two at the end of work. This should roughly only be about 1200mg which I’ve been told is completely fine to take and not damage anything. As soon as I took this medicine (within 10 minutes) I got this god awful feeling in my upper stomach area. It was like there was supposed to be pain but it wasnt?? Side note- this is the same feeling I get when I’m on my period, I don’t experience pain but I do feel the cramping and it’s VERY uncomfortable and just as bad in my opinion. However, this was more extreme and not in the uterus. 

Within the 10 minutes of taking it, I gagged trying to put my favorite food into my mouth and I couldn’t even chew it because I was about to throw up. Ran to the bathroom where I vomited and had violent diarrhea. The vomiting subsided and changed to severe nausea while the diarrhea didn’t show signs of stopping. I had to go every 30ish minutes and it was just pure liquid at this point. 

Later that day I take the next two pills, thinking maybe I just had something bad? Nope. I was feeling “better” but still pooping every 45minutes-1hour at this point and the same thing happened. I took the two pills (600mg) and within 3 minutes my stomach had an absolute uproar. Same thing happened- I didn’t throw up though. Just gagged a lot

The next day I wanted to try one more time so I took 1 pill during my first 15 at work and the 2nd as I was about to leave work. There was about 6 hours in between the first and second dose. SAME thing except it’s even worse. After that second pill, I refused to take any medicines and stayed home in hopes it would blow over with the sickness.

I went to 2 different drs (my primary physician had no openings) and both told me that I didn’t take enough to cause any liver damage- especially because I don’t take Tylenol, ibuprofen, any medications really. 
My medications are: lamotrigine, birth control pill, hydroxyzine, and minocycline (for acne), vitamin B6, and vitamin C

Both drs told me I had a virus and gave me a drs note for a few days to not go to work- HOWEVER - while my “sick” symptoms went away, the diarrhea has stayed. It’s only about 3-4x a day now and I’ve only thrown up once since missing work but I’m still kinda worried since this reaction only happened when I took the DayQuil. Am I allergic? Should I go to my primary physician? 

Note- my primary physician is also female and has been the only dr to ever listen to me and take things seriously.",,

Age: 32

Duration of complaint: 10 years
Past Medical History: Obstructive sleep apnea
Meds: None

I think i’m going to have surgery soon to try to correct my sleep apnea and this would be probably the most serious surgery i’ve ever had, although i realize it’s not that serious in the grand scheme of things. 

I’m looking for some suggestions of what are good questions to ask a surgeon before surgery. 

I had my deviated septum fixed and before that surgery I asked the doctor “Hey have you done this surgery a lot?” but like eyeballing this guy he was older and seemed experienced and he was like yeah i do these like multiple times a week. I didn’t really feel the need to ask any other questions in the case.

So besides “How many times have you done this surgery?” what are some good questions to ask?

Is there a way to ask “hey how many people have died while you were doing this surgery or due to complications afterwards”? i’m pretty okay with asking awkward stuff but that seems a little much. I kind of do want to know that though…

Also if a doctor was like yeah i’ve had 10 people die during this surgery but when I look up the general rate and it’s like 2% and this doctor is at or close to that, i think id be fine with that… I just kind of would like to know if the doctor is having like 10% of their patients die when the general rate is 2%. Is that even possible though? 

Also is there some kind of central database where I can look up a doctor and see how many times if any they’ve been sued for malpractice? Would that be a good thing to look at prior to surgery?",,

I had a colonoscopy in 2021 after experiencing severe pain and rectal bleeding (bright red and dark). Endoscopy was also ordered but they couldn’t do it at all. I woke up screaming in pain shortly after they started and they couldn’t go past my descending colon. They found 3 polyps (benign), largest 14mm, in my descending colon. GI doc kept saying I’m “too young” and my insides look like a 70 yr olds. Said I need to repeat the colonoscopy under general anesthesia and repeat again every 3 years. I had an upper endoscopy done in 2018 and also woke up freaking out during it. History of cancer on my moms side but not colon cancer. I’m positive for the v2424g high risk variant of the atm gene mutation. 

I had a lapse in insurance, moved, just saw a new GI doc in a new state to finally get this repeat colonoscopy done.

New GI doc said no one does colonoscopies under general anesthesia. End of story. She said *maybe* I can see a colorectal surgeon in a hospital who will *maybe* do general anesthesia in the OR if things go awry again. That was it and they canceled my appointment.

The procedure itself was uncomplicated, however I did have a PLPH for about 8 days after. I ended up in the ER 2 days post LP for the headache, the ER anesthesiologists were going to do a blood patch but decided not to due to me being sick with (self diagnosed, but confirmed not-covid) influenza A at the time and were worried about complications.

Up until a week ago there was no signs of bruising or swelling but now there is slight bruising visible and some distension about 2-3 inches below the LP site and allot of pain. 
I had an appointment with the neurologist 2 weeks ago and he ordered a ultrasound of the area which is scheduled for the 9th of January.

No drink no smoke
Propranolol 20mg x2 a day
Pristiq 50mg
Vyvanse 30mg as needed

So I’ve dealt with chronic headaches that often progress into migraines since I was like 10 and a few years ago I got prescribed propranolol.

The thing is, just talking with my mother now, she absolutely doesn’t believe that I’m taking it for migraines and that it’s for my anxiety. I do have anxiety but I am only finding on Google that propranolol taken for anxiety is just an “as needed” type thing and I take it twice a day every day. It is a very low dosage but I’m convinced my doctor just forgot to update my dosage once they found I had no adverse reactions because that is the lowest fucking dose ever??? Or maybe they forgot what they prescribed it for because I have chronic migraines and anxiety in my charts. And it’s no wonder I’ve seen that medicine do zero to help the frequency of migraines for me (but if I miss a dose I get dizzy so it’s doing something to my blood pressure) 
Even so, my mom swears I don’t have high blood pressure so they wouldn’t give me something to lower it. Lowkey fuming and also confused rn cause like I remember them prescribing it when I went into an appointment and told them my headache issue(not sure why it took so long for me to tell them).
I have a psychiatrist separate from my PCP at the same facility so they wouldn’t prescribe something for my mental illness when I don’t go to them for that. So what do you think? Is it for my anxiety or migraines? If this isn’t enough info I’ll just wait until my next appointment in February to ask my doctor but I decided to ask on here since February feels so far away. 

TL;DR: I take propranolol for migraines but my mom says its for anxiety when I don’t take it in the way that people who use it for anxiety do, but the dose is far lower than normal for an adult using it for migraines. I am diagnosed with both anxiety and chronic migraines so I’m worried my doctor just messed up the dosage and I’m also mad that my mom doesn’t believe that I in fact have high blood pressure (it runs in the family but I’m young so I MUST be in perfect health )",,

It did improve after some moving around and a hot shower, but after a few hours, it began to slowly come back. When I got up today, it was more sore, and it seemed to spread to my chest a bit, especially when hunched over (my normal sitting posture).

,,1327,"18m, not on any prescriptions and as far as I know this is the only I might have had a siezure 

I've heard story's from different blood relatives about them having siezures but those usually involved then using hard drugs, aside from my mom who's told me about her having siezures from just smoking weed. 



When I was 17 I had what I now believe was probably a siezure after I hit a dab pen ( think of it like a weed vape. If the specifics matter it was a kind of delta). I was standing in the line to get the tickets before you can get into the movie theater and at first I'd noticed that I could no longer read the screen with all the movies listed on it. Then it quickly got worse with a sort of orange static coming over my vision. Then I started getting what felt like random shapes circling around my body and random vibrating. Then I tried to tell one of the family members I was with that something wasn't right but I was only able to murmur. After that I just saw different shades of purple and some random videogame characters for a couple seconds. Then I woke up confused on a sidewalk while one of my family members were getting their car to come get me. Later learned that It looked like I'd just passed out while murmuring. 




When I woke up it felt almost identical to when you wake up from a very deep sleep. I'd honestly still been convinced I was sleeping for atleast a couple minutes after I'd woken up. Then for a while after that I couldn't tell the size of objects. For example we'd stopped at a gas station and I'd accidentally drank out of a 2 liter of mountain dew because I thought it was just a regular one. But everything went back to normal after a couple hours. And when I talked to my mom about it a few months later she was certain it was a siezure because it was similar to her siezures. 

I've smoked and hit dab pens after this and never had anything similar happen. 





Only reason I'm not 100% convinced its a siezure is because the family members I was with have both actually had siezures before and they say it couldn't have been one because i never siezed or convolsed. And I'd never seen a doctor to confirm if it was one. I do wanna bring it up with an irl doctor when I'm able to afford one but that'll take a while.",,

,,1333,"So tldr, coworker son has two large fecal impactions at the top of rectum. We were actually able to get out one through the help of a milk and molasses enema. One remains in the rectum but we aren't able to disimpact it as it's far too high up. We tried another milk and molasses enema but it didn't work. Nothing but the solution came out. We tried distilled water and soap suds enema and it didn't work either. We used a suppository but it was also uneventful. This has been going on for roughly a week give or take but we are getting worried. His son says his hand is starting to feel numb randomly through out the day and hes lost a lot of weight. We were turned away from the hospital 3 times but without any other options we went back today. Waited in the er and the doctor came out to talk to us roughly 4 hours later. She said that we were turned away last week and we shouldn't have come back. She wouldn't give us any treatment. We pleaded with her to help as the impaction is incredibly painful for his son but she said no and told us to leave but we were firm on seeking treatment. She called security on us so we had no choice but to leave. 

We don't know what to do. We were able to get one impaction out with milk and molasses but for some reason when we tried it later on, it never worked. Soap suds and suppositories didn't work and we are honestly really worried that the boy is going to die. People asked how old he is and he's 17.",,
,,1334,"(23M) A full year ago in December, I remember waking up and the left half of my face was super numb, my arms were numb, and I couldn't formulate anything to say out loud. I was in a treatment facility and nobody was awake and I was too scared to bring attention to myself. I paced around and sat down and after an hour I went back to sleep. I was really concerned but didn't tell anyone because I thought they wouldn't believe me.

This year I have been noticing a pattern of emerging symptoms that I can't explain why they showed up other than continuing vaping. When I tried to take a break this year in September, after a few days, I noticed I was super fatigued, it was significantly harder to exercise, hard to enjoy food and walking around, trouble understanding, reading, and listening, darkened eyesight (like 50% darker), hearing damage out of nowhere, crinkling in my ears, extreme moving pressure in my eyeballs, trouble focusing everyday, hard pressure against my eardrum and in my middle ear, tensed up skull and neck which I can't get to relax, brain dullness, air bubbles in my skull,

And for the past two weeks panicking, heart racing out of my chest for the whole day, shallow breath. I think maybe all this is caused by something that happened a year ago.

I read people find out from tests that they had strokes several years ago and it went unnoticed, and I also read people as young as me (23) had a stroke for any reason. I now read you lose brain cells if it goes untreated and this is what it feels like is happening to me. My brain feels like it's dying and my eyeballs feel like they are constantly being cut off from blood flow/oxygen.

My doctor wont contact me back until the 11th because of the holidays. I had been trying to inquire about an ophthalmologist to help with my darkening vision. I don't want to go to the emergency room just to be told I'm just panicking but the reason I'm panicking is because I feel like I urgently need a CT scan to see if this actually happened. What else could it be? The morning I woke up with a numb half of my face and thought I had a stroke was one of the few things I remember from this long ago. Can anyone tell me what to do? I don't want to continue losing 2 million brain cells each hour, and it's already been a year since this incident. I don't want these weird symptoms I'm experiencing to be permanent/irreversible.

What if the time I took the test affects my results? Men get erections all throughout the night in their sleep and when they wake up in the morning and have deeper voices. This is a sign of testosterone being higher at that time. Then throughout the day my voice doesn’t sound nearly as deep.

We’ve all had a really nasty cough and cold for the last week. A few days ago we were eating some Christmassy foods from the supermarket and I felt like I was having an allergic reaction - itching inside my mouth, felt like hives on the inside of my lips. I’d already checked the ingredients and there was nothing I’m allergic to on there, of course I checked again. I took an antihistamine and it eased off. I figured there must have been contaminants. It didn’t get really bad and wasn’t a major issue. 

its just happened again after taking some cough medicine - I checked the ingredients, nothing on there that I know would cause me an issue. I haven’t taken it before so it’s possible I could react to it but I don’t understand why it would happen on these two occasions since it’s rare for it to happen. 

I rarely ever have reactions. I’m very cautious generally with checking ingredients. Last serious reaction I had was over ten years ago in a restaurant - I’d told them my allergies but they brought out some kind of dip and I ate a bit without thinking. I’m more careful since. 

Is it possible the virus could be causing this? I’ve never experienced this before unless it’s a known allergen.

,,1353,"Christmas eve I had to take my wife to the hospital because I noticed a large bump near her rectum and she was having intense pain in the area. She ended up having a golf ball sized perianal abscess. 

An emergency OR team was called in and she had surgery within a couple of hours. They packed it and the surgeon told me the packing would be taken out before she left and she could go back to work the next day and to take some ibuprofen if she had any discomfort. Also said to clean it wish some dial soap in one of those bulbs you use for cleaning ears. 

Christmas night was rough, they never removed the packing so we called and asked about it and i was told I needed to remove it so that it didn't cause complications and by the next day we had to take her back to the ER because she was screaming in pain. I've seen this woman have large enough kidney stones that surgery was considered and this was worse. The hospitalit and ER doc both talked to my wife and were surprised she hadn't been given anything for her pain so they started her on pain meds and antibiotics because 1. She had been vomiting her antibiotics up from the pain and 2. Her heart rate and resperation were so bad that she triggered sepsis protocol. Those two doctors admitted her and moved her to the surgery floor so another surgeon could check on her when his shift started in the morning.

This morning we met with that surgeon and he seemed genuinely blown away by the fact that she was told to go back to work and take otc pain meds. He said considering she had a halfdollar sized hole with as many nerves as your eye has she should've been written off for at least 10 days and given decent pain medication. She should also be showering after any BM the first week if possible and doing soaks in warm soapy water. Also that we needed to get a peri bottle to effectively be able to clean the area if she couldn't bathe immediately after. All of these care instructions were left out by the first surgeon. In fact the after care instructions in her discharge consisted of ""follow aftercare instructions."" 

Considering 3 doctors, including another surgeon, were all shocked by the stance of ""go back to work and maybe take an ibuprofen"" I was curious what others thought about that choice. Is that valid advice from the original surgeon and the second one is just more worried about patient comfort? 

A family member of mine is convinced that it was done in retaliation for the surgeon being called in on Christmas eve but I couldn't believe a doctor would be THAT petty. 

I'm really just trying to gauge was this a valid call, was it ignorance, does it seem like malice. I don't know. I honestly don't plan to do anything with the information because my wife occasionally does work with this surgeon in her profession but for my own sanity I needed to get some other professionals opinions on the situation.

For the past couple days now, I have been experiencing this lower back pain that is significantly affecting my daily life. It is extremely painful to do normal things like walk stairs, use the bathroom, or get in and out of bed. I'm looking to see if there's anything I can do to remedy it myself for the time being (I tried taking ibuprofen and it did absolutely nothing). I am not sure if I should be staying up/active, or getting bed rest (because the pain is occurring either way).

Some details:

* It only happens when I move/sit/walk ""the wrong way"", but I generally do not realize which ""way"" that is until the pain already hits. It's not a constant pain and seems to be dependent on my position/movement, but it is random.
* It is localized to my lower right back. I would say near the sacroiliac region. It feels like a sharp stabbing pain, but it does not radiate down my leg like sciatica.
* I have scoliosis (diagnosed premenarchal at age 14, \~12 years ago); 26 degree right thoracic curve last checked Oct. 2013 after wearing an overnight back brace for \~2.5 years. 
* This type of pain has happened in the past many times but has never been this bad. It used to last longer time periods (\~1-2 weeks) with far less severity, but occurring more regularly. Now it occurs much less frequently and generally only lasts a few days, but it is extremely painful when it does happen.
* In the past I have been prescribed cyclobenzaprine (did not help) followed by steroid medication (also did not help). My PCP is a DO and I have seen her a handful of times to do a manipulation on my back, during which she said my right leg was longer than my left leg and I just needed to be leveled out (this only helped for short periods of time). I also did physical therapy for a couple months, after which the pain episodes became less frequent but more severe. I have always been told it's because of the asymmetry in my body from scoliosis and I've never had any type of x-rays or imaging recommended (not that I think I need it though).
* I have not experienced any type of recent trauma from exercise, injury, etc. or done anything particularly strenuous that could have triggered this. Any time I get this type of back pain, it occurs randomly (as far as I'm aware).

I appreciate any input or advice that anyone has. Thank you so much in advance.",,

Around 2 years ago (in early 2021) I found some bumps in my foreskin. After checking with some doctors, they diagnosed herpes simplex type-1, so the one we usually found in the mouth. I was a bit skeptical at the time, as I didn't had any adventure and my partner tested negative to this. 



Fast-forward to 2023, early this year, I noticed some pink drops in my pee after peeing. I cleaned with toilet paper and it was, indeed, pink. I went straight to the doctor and after some blood and pee analysis, they detected hemoglobin-myoglobin in my blood. The doctor said that it can happen after an intense exercise and asked me to wait to see if the pink pee went away. 



But it didn't. I went there again and the doc indicated me for a cystoscopy. I did it and the urologist there showed me a wound in my urethra. He said my bladder is fine, that the blood is coming from this wound. He indicated me for a Abdominal TAC to check the kidneys (which I'll do only next year :( ) and told me to go there again after to do another cystoscopy to see how the wound is. 



I'm super anxious with all this situation... No one tells me what could be causing this, how did I get a wound there? The pee didn't improve through the year, and I'm scared whatever is causing this can cause even serious complications...",,

She’s recently turned 4 and her constipation is just getting worse. Most of the time she doesn’t poo for 3/4 weeks. Sometimes longer. She’s on lactulose and senekot now. Sometimes it gets so bad she vomits. She’s bloated constantly and is desperate to poo but can’t. She frequently has an impacted bowel and is mortified about overflow in her knickers. She cries in pain about her stomach hurting. She’s been tested twice for celiacs through blood tests and it’s negative. It’s been flagged that she has issues absorbing iron and is low in iron through blood tests. 

She’s prescribed suppositories for when it’s really bad which do work, but sometimes it takes multiple over a few days. She hates them though and begs us screaming not to do it. It’s really traumatic for everyone. 

Her paediatrician basically says she’ll grow out of it. He won’t run any more tests as he doesn’t think it’s necessary but she spends her whole life constipated and has an impacted bowl once a month. She’s been on increasing medication for 3 and a half years. She gets plenty of water, high fibre, fruit and exercise. She’s not withholding (the opposite!). They mentioned there would be no physical cause for this and mentioned Hirschprung but said it was too rare and she’d been diagnosed at birth.

25F. 5 ft 4 in., about 130ish lbs. I take methadone daily, sometimes off-brand Claritin for allergies (dust, ragweed, cats) as needed. Vape nicotine and smoke weed daily. I carry a water bottle and chapstick around with me and use them both all day every day.

So when I was 14 I started getting this crusty, yellow, pushy, painful stuff all over my lips, especially in the corners of my lips. This started in the winter when I was 14 btw. Doctors did all kinds of blood tests and a culture, and I was negative for everything (including herpes simplex) except for cheilitis.

So I started using Carmex and my lips finally healed up completely. But ever since then I've had chronically dry lips that start to hurt and feel tight and dry if I don't apply chapstick at least every hour or so.

Someone told me several years back that carmex is bad and addicting to your lips, so I switched to Blistex medicated (the blue tubes) instead and have been using that ever since. I tried an Aquaphor chapstick recently and it was the best one I've ever tried (up until then carmex and blister medicated were the only ones that have ever worked for me). Unfortunately aquaphor is 4x the price, so we literally can't afford to buy it as often as I need it. So I do still use the blue blistex.

When I was 16 or 17 I got extremely painful sores all over my vagina and rectum, and was diagnosed with herpes simplex virus 1 through blood and culture tests.

Since then, I occasionally have breakouts on my lips as well. I rarely get them anymore tho. 

A couple weeks ago, I got this ""pimple"" (cold sore? Idk) right above/on the edge of my top lip. I tried to pop it and it was extremely painful and only a clear liquid came out.

Actually a few days before this, I got a pimple on the edge of my right nostril and popped it, and a little white pus came out, and since then it's just been stabbing over and bleeding and causing me so much pain, especially when I need to blow my nose :(.

Over the past couple weeks, the corners of my lips have been getting extremely chapped and painful, made worse every night because I can't stop drooling in my sleep and sometimes sleeping with my mouth open cause ig I can't breathe through my nose in my sleep sometimes. I've also been getting this itchy redness on/around the edges of my lips and a red rash on/right below my lower lip on the left side that just keeps getting worse and more painful as well.

I also got a second pimple looking thing right below my lower lip on the right side about a week ago. I haven't tried to pop that one or anything else since the first time on the first one. 

Idk if I have cheilitis, acne, and cold sores, or some combination of those, but I have been in increasing pain every day and my lips look and feel worse and worse every time I wake up :(. Please help! I think I might have some valcyclovir somewhere that I can take if it is indeed a cold sore breakout btw.

Strongly suspected c-PTSD

I keep waking up randomly an hour or so after I’ve fallen asleep in a weird daze. Often it involves intense panic and fear, with me convincing myself that I’ve forgotten to do something extremely important, like take birth control pills. Often this also includes some other delusional thinking, like that I’ve forgotten to feed my cat for a week and it is starving (I don’t have a cat in the apartment I live in). 

I often switch the lights on in panic and fear, and run around the house, waking up fully in various rooms, before questioning why I’m doing what I’m doing. I realise quickly that I’m having one of those panic episodes again, and go back to sleep, and the cycle usually continues again the next night.

2am postpartum anxiety spiral has me convinced my baby is in heart failure or has a defect. 
We were at the er on Thursday night for a fever and congestion. 
He’s been a little sweaty on his head when nursing the last few days and I was looking over his tests from the hospital, i saw this on his xray results- The heart, mediastinum, and pulmonary vasculature are normal. There is mild peribronchial thickening. No lung consolidation or pleural effusions are present. No pneumothorax is present. 

Now I’m freaked out based on some articles about peribronchial cuffing and heart failure. 
He was also mildly tachycardic (189) when we got there but he was crying. When they retook his pulse when he was calm it was 159. I’m going to reach out to my pediatrician when they open again in the morning but I’ve freaked myself out on Google. 
Should I be concerned by that x ray finding?",,
